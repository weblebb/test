# Testing Codium AI Pull Request Agent (Open Source)
AI can now review your pull requests!

🚀We're excited to announce our next step in our mission to create an intelligent software
development world. Today, we're launching pr-agent, our open-source Pull Request (PR) Agent,
that you can summon for analyze and provide feedback on your pull requests.🤖

🗨️You can summon the agent by simply addressing @CodiumAI-Agent in the PR comments,
 or automatically by installing the pr-agent to your repo.
 
🐎By providing an overview of the PR and in-depth analysis, our pr-agent expedites the PR
approval process. It gives developers and repo maintainers information on the PR’s main
theme, whether it follows repo guidelines, suggests code improvements, and more.
